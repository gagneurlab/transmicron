# sample config file, you don't need to change anything here as it is not used when executing the pipeline and is provided just as an illustration of how a config file will look like when running python run.py with given parameters, a file similar to this one named user_config.yaml will be created and fed into the snakemake pipeline.

# which version of the mutagenesis model is used?
####

#please choose one of:
#"pretrainedModel": use pre-calculated insertion rates based on mESC data)
#"noMutagenesis": use no mutagenesis model, TransMiCron will control only for the distribution of TA / TTAA sites
#"predefinedFeatures": retrain the mutagenesis model on your own insertion data, using our pre-defined features
#"customFeatures": retrain the mutagenesis model using your own features -> please supply BED file below
#"AddCustomFeatures": retrain the mutagenesis model using our features + your own features -> please supply BED file below

mutagenesis_method: ["predefinedFeatures"] #default = "pretrainedModel"
customFeatures: ["Input/FeatureBeds/DNASEmesc_SRX1452763.05.bed", "Input/FeatureBeds/DNASEmesc_SRX1452763.05.bed"] 

####
#define the target annotation
####
annotation: ["genes"] # choices: "genes", "10kb", "20kb"...(any number of kbs possible), "custom" (if custom: please supply BED file below)
customAnnotation: "Input/testAnnot.BED"  #if "custom" annotation is used, please supply path to BED file (columns: "chr" (content: chr1, chr2...chrX,chrY) "start" (number), "end"(number), name (optional))

####
# additional options
####

# multiple testing method
multest_correction: ["bonferroni"] #recommended choice: "bonferroni"; other choices: "BH", "BY", "none"

#should promoters be added to the target annotations?
promoters: 0 #Default: 0; please enter a number
